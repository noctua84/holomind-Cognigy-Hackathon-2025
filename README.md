## 📚 Package Usage Examples

### Training Visualization and Monitoring (tensorboard, psutil, tqdm)
```python
# Using tensorboard for training visualization
from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter
from psutil import Process

writer = SummaryWriter('runs/experiment_1')
process = Process()

def train_with_monitoring(model, epochs, data):
    for epoch in tqdm(range(epochs)):
        loss = model.train_step(data)
        
        # Log metrics to tensorboard
        writer.add_scalar('Loss/train', loss, epoch)
        writer.add_scalar('Memory/usage', process.memory_info().rss, epoch)
```
**Pattern**: Observer Pattern - Monitors training progress and system resources
- Tensorboard creates visualizable logs in './runs' directory
- psutil tracks memory usage during training
- tqdm provides progress feedback for long-running operations

### Experiment Management (MLflow, Optuna)
```python
# Using MLflow for experiment tracking
import mlflow
import optuna

def optimize_hyperparameters():
    mlflow.set_experiment("holomind_optimization")
    
    def objective(trial):
        with mlflow.start_run(nested=True):
            # Define hyperparameters to tune
            lr = trial.suggest_float("lr", 1e-5, 1e-2, log=True)
            layers = trial.suggest_int("layers", 2, 5)
            
            # Train model and return metric
            model = NeuralNetwork(layers=layers, lr=lr)
            return model.train()
    
    study = optuna.create_study(direction="maximize")
    study.optimize(objective, n_trials=100)
```
**Pattern**: Strategy Pattern with Automated Optimization
- MLflow tracks experiments and metrics
- Optuna automates hyperparameter search
- Each trial represents a different model configuration

### State Management and Storage (h5py, DVC)
```python
# Using h5py and DVC for model state management
import h5py
from dvc import api

class StateManager:
    def save_state(self, model, epoch, metrics):
        with h5py.File(f'models/state_{epoch}.h5', 'w') as f:
            # Save model weights
            f.create_dataset('weights', data=model.state_dict())
            # Save training metrics
            f.create_dataset('metrics', data=metrics)
        
        # Track with DVC
        api.add(f'models/state_{epoch}.h5')
        api.commit(f"Save model state at epoch {epoch}")
    
    def load_state(self, epoch):
        with h5py.File(f'models/state_{epoch}.h5', 'r') as f:
            weights = f['weights'][:]
            metrics = f['metrics'][:]
        return weights, metrics
```
**Pattern**: Repository Pattern with Version Control
- h5py provides efficient binary storage for large arrays
- DVC tracks changes in model states and data
- Allows for reproducible experiments and state rollback

### Distributed Training (Ray)
```python
# Using Ray for distributed training
import ray
from ray import train
from ray.train import Trainer

@ray.remote
class DistributedTrainer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = NeuralNetwork()
    
    def train_shard(self, data_shard):
        return self.model.train(data_shard)

def distributed_training(data):
    ray.init()
    trainer = Trainer(backend="torch")
    
    # Split data across workers
    trainers = [DistributedTrainer.remote() for _ in range(4)]
    data_shards = split_data(data, num_shards=4)
    
    # Train in parallel
    futures = [trainer.train_shard.remote(shard) 
              for trainer, shard in zip(trainers, data_shards)]
    results = ray.get(futures)
```
**Pattern**: Actor Pattern for Distributed Computing
- Ray creates distributed actors for parallel processing
- Each actor trains independently on a data shard
- Results are aggregated from all workers

### Memory-Efficient Operations (torch-sparse, numba)
```python
# Using torch-sparse and numba for efficient operations
import torch_sparse
from numba import jit

@jit(nopython=True)
def efficient_memory_update(weights, gradients):
    # Numba-accelerated memory update logic
    return updated_weights

class EfficientLayer:
    def forward(self, x):
        # Use sparse operations for memory efficiency
        sparse_x = torch_sparse.tensor.SparseTensor(x)
        return sparse_x.matmul(self.weights)
```
**Pattern**: Optimization Pattern for Resource Management
- Numba compiles Python code for faster execution
- torch-sparse reduces memory usage for sparse operations
- Combines JIT compilation with sparse matrix operations
